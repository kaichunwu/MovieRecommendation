1,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I'll be honest, when I went into to cinema to watch this movie I was expecting to not like it. I had seen a little bit of the trailer and it did not really ""speak"" to me and Alita's eyes were off putting. When the movie had begun I was actually searching for things to dislike but surprisingly there were none apart from a few cringeworthy moments. I quickly got used to Alita's eyes and they became in fact likeable. The story began to draw me in and I got completely absorbed into the story and the visuals.

The world is extraordinary and beautiful and the action scenes in this movie are fantastic, quite honestly some of the best I have seen. The story is a bit fast paced but not to a degree that it feels rushed. Alita as a character is great, she is kind-hearted, innocent, naive and protective. Throughout the movie Alita grows as a person and learns about sacrifice, loss, love and the horrors of the human mind. Alita is very likeable because she is such a good person in such a horrible world and you can't help feeling very sympathetic for an innocent being like her as she is exposed to the cruel world of Iron City.

I watched this movie without knowing the source material and I loved it. I was drawn in very early on and had to watch it a second time. I can definitely recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"Wow !! Truly amazing film of this year !! Great story telling !! For director Robert Rodriguez you has created a good film !! With three oscar winning actor/actress and with a name as big as James Cameron already make this film so amazing !! Dear Alita i'm falling in love with your 'BIG EYE '. For all of you , go see it you wont regret it !!"
3,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,I really love this movie. The storyline is really great. Exciting from start to finish. The graphics are really cool. Its like I didn't wanna blink at all. The plot is not mind-numbing as critics say. Well it seems like I have to stop listening to them. Because this film is worth watching by everyone. Thank you for all people behind this movie. I'm sure this movie wasn't easy to make. Now I really hope I don't have to wait too long for the sequel...
4,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),10,"Alita Battle Angel is what happens when Hollywood finally get an Anime film right, ive gotta say James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez should work more together because this film is incredible.

This film had heart and soul poured into its story and you could tell that 1000 of hours of work have gone into making this film. They've pulled one of the best films this year with incredible visual effects and CGI work that give this film a beautiful setting and background.

The visual effect of Alita (voiced by Rosa Salazar) we're incredibly done giving detail in her eyes which made her character on screen look more like an actual human actress. Her character and acting is what made this film, they give her a human soul and a purpose with the writing which is so well done, it gives the audience an emotional journey of a young woman trying to discover who she is.

The love interest side of the film is so done right it doesn't feel forced as well which along with its action sequences as well as it supporting cast was nothing short of perfect. The story does a great job of not revealing too much to earlier as slowly building up characters so you understand the story and draws you into every moment, this is matched by the awesome fight scenes and great formidable villains of the film adding to incredible film.

This is one of those films that deserves a sequel and to be a successful film as of what they've realised here is one of the best live action anime films, with a damn near perfect if it was for slight pacing issue that doesn't really affect the film but is noticeable.

Does it live up to the hype? HELL YES this film live up to the hype this is a must to watch on teh big screen hopefully were see a sequel come from it because it so needs it.

Dislikes: The only flaw I spotted as ive said there was a slight issue with pacing, not that it affects the film in any way but was noticeable."
5,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I've always loved Anime, and it's always been frustrating watching Hollywood movies destroy it (Ghost in the shell). Alita however did an amazing job in fusing Hollywood and Anime. I believe it was a great story adaptation by James Cameron, breathtaking action scenes and directing by Rodriguez, and great casting. I saw this in 4DX 3D in Seoul and It was a roller coaster ride. I was afraid the movie might put me to sleep, but it kept me engaged and watching from beginning to end. I think the most important element for movies should be the ability to engage the audience and never let them go until the very end. This movie delivers. And also I am very proud of Director Rodriguez for taking on this enormous task. He put a lot on the line to make this film. An interesting thing I found was for some reason I felt there were elements of John Carpenter here. Overall one of the best 3D films made so far. I believe the bar has been pushed higher for all filmmakers. A must watch in 3D exerpience!"
6,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"But the romance threw us off a bit. But this is way much better than Ghost in the Shell and Ready player one. The story was amazing, made sense, didn't jump from one element to another and the pasting was perfect. The visuals are stunning! Absolutely 10/10. But the romance...everyone in the cinema giggled when Hugo died, it just didn't work, nobody cared about the character anyway. He was simply there to have a love interest for Alita. Summing it up, definitely worth watching, looking forward for the next one!"
7,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"Marvelous effect with some great actions make this movie not to be missed seeing it in the big screen. But the thing I love the most is Alita herself. There were a few times I had a smile on myself watching Alita as she was so loveable and badass. Really really hope it will goes beyond just this one movie as the world building in Alita was so fascinating and of course, need to see more Alita."
8,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),10,"""I WILL NOT STAND BY IN THE PRESENCE OF EVIL"", an inspiring line spoken by the protagonist in Alita: Battle Angel when facing an indomitable and frightening villain got me thinking that I will not stand by in the presence of clueless movie critics giving lukewarm reviews to this excellent movie. Hence my motivation in writing this review to a film that I consider a great visionary triumph with such groundbreaking special effects not experienced since Avatar and a world-building as dazzling as last year's critically acclaimed Blade Runner 2049.

Based on the manga by Kishiro, the creative combo of Rodriguez and Cameron have created a world so technically stunning and cinematically immersive that it stirred and delighted my soul during the whole movie.

At its heart, Alita is a tantalizing adventure about teenage self discovery and self fulfillment, although disguised by the plot which stated the protagonist as a 300 year-old alien berserker. The story combines science fiction with martial arts in a dystopian future. The fight scenes are as well choreographed as say The Matrix but avoid over indulging in extended and repetitive fight sequences. There's a lot of exposition fitted into a 2-hour movie, hence some scenes seemed to be truncated in order for the story to advance accordingly.

That said, the plot has familiar elements made new but in more interesting ways. Elements of a world constantly being monitored borrow heavily from The Hunger Games, with the adrenaline infusing Motorball acting as ""the game"". The action scenes are thrilling, at times violent but as explained earlier, never over indulges. And when such scenes are short, I found myself wanting for more, hence repeat viewing ensues.

The film ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger, with fanboys like me hoping against pessimistic box office forecast that this movie will make enough money to warrant 2 more sequels to complete the overarching story of one of the most interesting female characters in one of the most visually arresting, imaginative and energetic science fiction movies of all time.

Go watch Alita: Battle Angel. Highly recommended."
9,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I'm a 47 year old man who went to film school. I loved this movie. There's no point in trying to dissect what Alita: Battle Angel got right or wrong in terms of script or pacing or character development or whatever else film snobs like to blather on about. This is just a fun, action-packed first installment of what I hope will at least be a trilogy, if not more. And they couldn't have cast Alita more perfectly, even if her on-screen form is completely digital. Great movie. Tons of fun. Don't overthink it."
10,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I was hoping this movie would not disappoint, and it did not... at least in the aspect of action, and some drama, but not so much on the storyline. I understand there's only so much one can fit in a 2 hour span for a story that was originally a multi-volume Japanese Manga (a graphic novel equivalent to western standards), though I think a director's cut release would alleviate some of the over-fast paced developments and some 'holes' in the story. Overall, as mentioned in the headline, the action is AMAZING, the visuals can at times make you forget that the scenes and characters are done CGI (I saw it in IMAX and it was GREAT). Even though as mentioned, that the storyline is a bit wanting (in my honest opinion), it's enough to make one care for the characters and for the final outcome of the story. Music, sets the tone and mood as to be expected of such a release and acting is top notch from all actors.

~Final verdict~ Action: 10/10 Music: 9/10 Storyline: 7/10 OVERALL: 9/10 (must see as a 'Sci-fi action flick of the year')"
11,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),10,I have had very high expectations for Alita: Battle Angel ever since this colab between Cameron and Rodriguez were first announced. Since Last Jedi I have decided not to watch any reviews before seeing the movie myself. I watched an early screening yesterday and I were not disappointed. Reading up on some of the reviews after I were very surprised to find that especially the very first reviews from the press screenings were actually rather negative. For me this is one of the best Action Adventure Sci-Fi movies in a very long time. For me it is an easy 10.
12,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),10,"First review I've ever written cause I want, no I need to promote this movie in every way I can, emotional stories, fantastic characters and an amazing plot line filled with epic moments and fight scenes that blew me away"
13,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),3,"Alita is a cyborg picked up from a rubbish dump below a floating city. A well-mannered doctor repairs her, gives her a new body, and she awakens with no memory of who she is and no knowledge of the world around her. I liked this a lot (yes, even a movie as terrible as this can have positives), because it meant the lead character went along with the audience learning about the extravagant world, it's history, and her own identity. We knew as much as she did. Unfortunately where this came apart was in trying to develop a world far too deep and rich for the film's runtime, and without adequately tying it to the core narrative. Exposition dumps felt forced in, and often had little bearing or pay-off.

But that was only one part of the film's script problems. The biggest one for me was it trying to combine two separate stories from the original manga. Even when haphazardly combined as they were in the movie, it was plainly obvious that the two stories were not meant to co-exist, and the film makes little effort to actually marry them together. On the one hand we have the story of Alita's awakening in a dark city full of murders, body part theft, and bounty hunters keeping the law. This was actually my favourite narrative of the whole thing, and I wish they'd doubled down on it, not least because it ties into Alita's background and specialisations naturally.

The second story they tried to shoe-horn in was a sporting event called Motorball, where cyborgs race around a track destroying each other and the winner is the last one standing or the first to score a goal with the titular motorball. Or at least I think that's how it worked, the rules of the sport were never clearly explained. Beyond being the least interesting part of the whole movie, and really just being there for some additional action sequences, the way they tried to tie it to the overall narrative was cack-handed to say the least. Everyone seems to have their fingers in bounty hunting and the Motorball, be they good guys or bad guys. Alita's love interest seems to have connections to both Alita's doctor, and the organiser (known as Vector) of the Motorball, through providing them with stolen body parts. Okay that works, but Vector is also under the thumb of Nova who seems to have a personal relation to Alita. Vector also works with the doctor's ex-wife who simultaneously works in the lab fixing Nova's criminal workers, and in the Motorball pits fixing up the contenders. If the over-coincidence of everyone knowing everyone else and all running in the same circles wasn't enough, background characters even share these insane connections; a number of bounty hunters also participate in Motorball.

And each and every one of these characters seemed to have a ""massive revelation"" about who they really were. Oh my god the doctor's the murderer! Oh no wait he's a bounty hunter! Oh wow he was married to that evil-looking woman who works for Vector! Oh wait she's also at the Motorball! Oh look so's Vector! Of course Hugo knows all of them. Oh and he's the guy stealing body parts, of course. And yes, obviously he has connections at the Motorball arena, who wouldn't. Every ten minutes we were meant to gape at the latest character revelation. By the time Nova takes his glasses off to reveal Edward Norton (and yet not reveal anything else about his character whatsoever), I'd had enough and just wanted to go home.

Ultimately the Motorball sequences were pointless. They had no pay-off at all. They did nothing but dilute the film in unnecessary world-building, haphazardly set-up the next film (that won't happen) with a frustrating and anti-climatic cliffhanger, and provide additional action sequences just in case anyone was getting bored with the over-rushed pacing that was trying too hard to squeeze too much in. As a result the film had no breathing room. We had no time to become attached to the characters, and the editing sliced off the ends of important scenes in order to rush through to the next exposition dump. We're at the doctors, now we're at the Motorball, now we're in the streets, now we're in a lab, now we're back at the doctors, now we're on the streets again. Cut. Cut. Cut.

And oh my god that ending. Sorry I have to go back to that diabolical ending. The film spends it's runtime rushing through every point because there's so much story, worldbuilding, and background detail to fill in. By the time we get to the credits, the film still hasn't even finished the story. In fact it feels like the entire third act was cut out. The secondary villains have been dealt with, the love interest has tragically died (through stupidity and a complete lack of logic), the main villain's revealed to be Edward Norton, and then we get a timelapse as Alita works her way to becoming Champion and going up to the city to confront her foe and...credits. Yes, that's where the credits are. Right where the film starts to feel like it might start getting interesting, we might get some answers, and we might start to get some payoff from what's been set-up so far.

Oh there's so much more, I'm not even done yet. The dialogue is awful, the acting is terrible, the characters are shallow. Rosa Salazar did a decent job with Alita and that cringeworthy dialogue, and Mahershala Ali flits between Vector and Nova effortlessly, but Christoph Waltz and Jennifer Connolly are wasted, Rodriguez favourites Eiza Gonzalez and Jeff Fahey are little more than one-line cameos (Fahey's character was interesting, with cybernetic dogs, while Gonzalez's character was a complete waste of her...natural assets). Jackie Earl Haley was apparently in this movie as well. Keean Johnson needs acting lessons, Ed Skrein was just Francis in a cybernetic body, and Jorge Lendeborg was just as annoying as he was in Bumblebee.

On the note of the visual effects, yeah okay, that was pretty decent. Any praise heaped on that is worth it for sure. Alita is almost unrecognisably CGI, with such an incredible amount of attention put into detail, lighting, animation, the whole works. That said, I don't see why she needed to be full-CGI when a simple touch-up on live-action Salazar would probably have sufficed. Her body could easily have been a bodysuit refined in post-production, her hair would've appeared a whole lot more natural, and her signature eyes could easily have been an add-on instead of the whole reason for re-rendering her entire body. Furthermore it would've reduced the uncanny valley feeling she gave off, and married her with her live-action companions much easier. The creation of the city is great; dark and dangerous, without feeling overbearing and unlivable, while the advancements in technology were a sight to behold (like a motorbike with one big wheel, or the city walls being made of pure water, or the numerous amounts of cybernetic enhancements almost everyone seemed to sport).

I could go on, but I'm just ranting. I found myself bored and uninterested within the first ten minutes of the movie, but I hoped it would improve as it went along. It didn't. It just got worse, and my sighs got louder. There's too many coincidences, too many plot holes, the romance sub-plot lacked romance, even the action scenes started to feel too hyperstylised and became boring. What's worse is that all that worldbuilding (which for once I might actually say there was too much) never had any payoff. We never get to see even glimpses of this fabled city everyone keeps talking about, the Motorball sidequests were pointless and took up far too much of the running time. Characters have no depth, their motivations make no sense, and every single one of them feels like they're in their own movie separated from everyone else. Key example here being when Alita walks into the bounty hunter bar and is told everyone looks out for themselves and compete for the bounties, to which her response is to immediately attempt a rousing speech to unite everyone against a ""common"" enemy that no-one else has even heard of. Of course it fails and she looks like an idiot. Yeah, they made the titular Battle Angel look like an idiot. I'm sorry, 3/10. It's only February and I feel like I've already seen the worst movie of the year. Do yourself a favour and save your time and money. Watch something else this half term."
14,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),10,"Alita: Battle Angel is the first ever anime adaptation that works, and its flawless. It stays true to the source material and does the original characters and themes of the manga justice. Rosa Salizars (Alita) is some of the best acting I have seen, the facial performance and overall dynamics will leave you wanting more time with her. Genuine and fresh as well as an inspiration for many of the movies you see today, waiting for the technology to be created for this movie was completely worth it. An ambitious technological marvel that will impress you every time you watch it."
15,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),8,"As a longtime fan of Gunnm(Battle Angel Alita), I am satisfied. I appreciate the production team took their time to do the research of the original serials. The adaptation is great, they filtered out few ""acquire taste"" and swapped in elements that would make much more appeal to general public. The film really kept true to the original manga and reassembled almost everything from the manga the scenes, mechanical bodies, characters and the world they lived in. They did a great job on capturing Alita's slightly naïve stubbornness, the ""all in or all out"" euthanasic, and the pursuit of who she is. Storywise, the film ingeniously weaved the first 11 books of manga together, brought up few events that was happening in the 2nd chapter of Alita's adventure to the 1st movie. Which is nice since I bet they're already thinking of the next Alita movie. But as few of Cameron's work, the dark side and the ugliness of irontown wasn't rendered enough. The lack of depth on the ugliness made the whole plot a bit light, the emotional conflict wasn't intense enough and the romance plotline which is very important in the 1st chapter a little bit lack of depth. The overall CG is stunning. Other than the wanted flyer and the parasite's face the rest of CG is absolute marvelous. All in all, definite a great Gunnm movie, will definite watch it again and again till the sequel is out!!!"
16,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),3,"Alita feels like a 10 hour TV season that has been fan-edited into 2 hours. If you were a fan of the season, you wouldn't mind, because it might be fun to just chop around between episodes you remember loving.

As a film though, you don't have this reference, so there is no clear arc to be aware of in the background. What you suspect would be a whole majestic episode about Alita being taken to the sunken ship, and discovering the suit is cut down into a few significant but flippant minutes culminating in a character saying ""that can't be good"" as she walks out of the water. Every potential story is treated like this, casually chopped to pieces and inter-spliced with the other.

As a result, you can't engage or care about any particular element. You won't get those 'Iron Man' feelings of Alita finally emerging victorious with her battlesuit, because the build-up and empathy just isn't there. You won't feel the philosophical soul of AI or Ghost in the Machine, because there is no room for her confusion or self-awareness to breathe. You won't feel any anxiety or tension in the fight-scenes, because you've seen the slick-CGI-pre-vis'd beyond all credibility so many times before you know there is nothing really at stake.

You've seen every element before, but delivered with more story-telling skill. If you have any sense of taste, judgement or cinema whatsoever, you'll be distracted by thinking what this project could have been, if someone had actually ADAPTED the source material rather than been intimidated by it and thrown everything at the wall to see what sticks.

Its cheesy, corny, bland, vanilla, generic and predictable in all the ways you deeply hope we've moved beyond. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey feels wildly interesting and inventive in comparison. Its certainly more SPY KIDS (the sequels even) than Avatar (and I'm no Avatar fan-boy)."
17,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),8,"Screenplay Co written and adapted by Avatar creator, James Cameron and Sin City creator Robert Rodriguez. Alita is a deep film that covers a wide range of themes such as female empowerment, personal growth, sacrifice and loss.

The world is wonderfully imagined. Its also incredibly beautiful. In 3D, Alita looks amazing, she's vibrant and full of life, her skin looks so natural. Some people are moaning about the eyes. But those people are missing the point that Alita isn't human. Battle Angel borrows from other sci-fi stories in places. But this is a 20 year old graphic novel series. You can't expect total originality here. But like it's cousin, Avatar, Alita manages to carve out an interesting new world for itself, which in some ways is similar to its protagonist.

The film had drawn some criticism for Alita's portrayal, as overly sexualized. I would argue those critics have entirely missed points made in the film. Or perhaps they haven't even seen it yet. Without giving anything away: calling Alita out for having an unrealistically small waist and big eyes is like moaning that the terminator sets an unfair standard for men. They're not human!

Whilst I really enjoyed Alita, it could have, should have, been two films. There's so much going on that at times, some scenes can seem insignificant on reflection. In the grand scope of the story some moving moments are lost. Some feel a little rushed.

So overall, a good film. Personally I loved it. Visually it's stunning. If you love sci-fi, if you liked Avatar or if you're a film lover, go see it! But watch it in IMAX 3D or at least 3D. Most films aren't worth it. But like Avatar: This isn't just 3D, this is James Cameron 3D. It's made for 3D."
18,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I don't know what to say... This movie is perfect as an Action-Sci Fi movie!. Not too much drama. Just enough. Cool action/fighting scene. Fights are not too long. Short and sweet. I guess people who rated this so low.. they don't even like a Scifi/Action genre or don't know how to enjoy this type of movie.

CGI is always very smooth except at the near ending scene where they going up on the pipe. Real face of his boyfriend with cyborg body looks disappointing...not neat at all...

We need a sequel!!! better.. badder!!"

20,Alita: Battle Angel (2019),9,"I love the way the director delevoped the character. He's been successfully made not only the character fearless, but also considerate. The action sequences are also the essential elements of this movie and they executed them perfectly. I wish the script could be better knowing that it is almost impossible to build a 2-hour movie script based on a multi-volume manga to explain the whole story. But overall, this movie is worth watching and deserves to be at least nominated for Best Visual Effects"
