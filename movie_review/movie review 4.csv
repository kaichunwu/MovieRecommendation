1,The Wandering Earth (2019),7,"The Wandering Earth is a Chinese science-fiction blockbuster based upon the critically acclaimed novella of the same name by award-winning author Liu Cixin. The movie convinces with stunning visual and sound effects that bring a dystopian world to live. The action sequences are intense. The acting performances are solid enough to make you care about the fates of the characters until the spectacular ending. Imagine a revamped mixture of Armageddon and The Day After Tomorrow with all the contemporary aesthetics and you know what you will get from this film.

The movie tells the story of a dying sun that endangers our planet to a point that it needs to be moved out of the Solar System and to the Alpha Centauri system with giant thrusters running on fusion power. The film follows a family consisting of an experienced grandfather who has worked as a trucker on the planet's frozen surface, an absent father who works as an astronaut on an international space station, a rebellious son who is sick and tired of living in the underground and his naive adopted sister who dreams of discovering the world. The son and his adopted sister try to escape from the underground and are being followed by the grandfather who wants to save them while the father has to make sure the planet's voyage progresses smoothily. As Jupiter's gravity attracts the wandering planet which could lead to a fatal disintegration that would annihilate mankind, the four protagonists are suddenly in the middle of a desperate rescue mission.

The only issue I have with this movie is the story itself. This isn't a science-fiction story because the scientific part is so unrealistic that this can basically be categorized as a fantasy movie. It's hard to fully get into the story and appreciate the film because the plot is nonsensical to a point that it almost becomes ridiculous. That is obviously not exactly the fault of the filmmakers but of the source material and one has to wonder why such an unrealistic novella has achieved so much critical acclaim.

If you are ready to ignore the fact that the plot doesn't make any sense whatsoever, you can appreciate visually stunning popcorn cinema of epic proportions for two entertaining hours. However, the movie is slightly overrated and there are even better contemporary Chinese science-fiction movies like the gripping Reset that recalls elements of the film Looper."
2,The Wandering Earth (2019),7,"In terms of setting, plot and performance, three stars. But special effects industry and theme breakthroughs should be encouraged to add one star more. One by one: 1. Setting, getting sick. Look at the trajectory maps of various satellites. If Jupiter's influence is not clear, would you dare to start wandering and die? I respect your planetary engine and ask you to follow the basic knowledge of exploring the universe. 2. The plot, Dongshi effect. Based on Hollywood's mature commercial film model, the plot is promoted through the sacrifice of several characters. But why do these people do that? In particular, Han Duoduo's cumbersome, from the beginning is a logical black hole, but also gave a sensational speech, how can he? 3. Plain performance. Several starring performances are still on-line, but none of them stand out. 4. Industrialization and special effects are earth-shaking. The film's greatest achievement should be in special effects and film industrialization. For the first time, it shows that China can also have first-class visual effects in Hollywood."
3,The Wandering Earth (2019),9,"Dont think science,just enjoy, this was a fantastic chinese film , though we have seen a lot of it before it is great visual and digital effects and some superb imaginative fantasies, a not to forget, a silent bang in space,heir heir, that never happens in the hollywood space,were it bangs infinity in and out ,vacuum is kabuum anyhow and anywhere in those circuits..

the grumpy old man only regrets that he didnt see this on the large screen. well recommended."
4,The Wandering Earth (2019),10,"The Sun is expanding and threatening to destroy year. The whole world unites to share technology and convert the planet in a slow moving space craft that will took about 2500 to change to another solar system. The trip requires people to live underground; but as you might expect, things do no go as expected and Earth get trapped no Jupiter gravity and the planets are about to collide.

The movie as fair amount of primary, secondary and tertiary characters. All of them has their shinning moments. The situations get more complicated by the minute. In the Chinese tradition, there are some melodramatic moments that slow down the otherwise frenetic pace of the movie. The movie is spectacular in almost every sense. Images, action scenes and production values. Let's hope the rest of the trilogy gets made and we are able to enjoy it."
5,The Wandering Earth (2019),7,"The Wandering Earth' is one of China's first forays into big-budget sci-fi - and it mostly works! The premise of the film hits close to home - severe drought, extreme weather, tsunamis pointing to the extinction of humans. Set in the near future, the more unrealistic part of the plot is that the sun is going to explode and devour the Milky Way, so all the Earth's governments decide to move the planet to another solar system. Pretty far fetched, but they try to stick to some scientific principles, such as oceans freezing, temperatures plummeting, billions dying - but I'm not sure how plausible thousands of giant rocket boosters and underground cities would be. But it is science-FICTION.

While the special effects are good - although still funny to see Earth being driven through space like a spaceship - the film does well to focus on six main characters. These are Liu Qi (Qu), his sister Duoduo (Jaho), their dad Liu Peiqiang (Wu) trapped on the space station, their granddad Han (Ng), captain Lei (Li) and scientist Yiyi (Zhang), as they try to get a replacement engine to one of the rockets on the surface. Some of it is needlessly melodramatic, but in general the balance between humanity and CGI is well done.

It's a nice mix of 'The Day After Tomorrow', '2012' (but better than both) and '2001: A Space Odyssey' - and thankfully much better than 'The Great Wall'. I found the subtitles and action easy to read/follow. Nice score and there's some humour in with the end-of-the-world-ness."
6,The Wandering Earth (2019),8,"Wow, this movie has a brilliant storyline - the sun is dying, and orbit thrusters are being used to push our planet Earth into a new, safe star system. The visual effects in this film are breathtaking and outstanding. The story and screenplay are very well constructed and portrayed on screen.

Best of all, it teaches everyone the important lesson that no matter what the odds are against you, no matter how low the possibility of winning may be, you should not go down without a good fight ; where there is a will, there is a way. Never lose hope, and never give up."
7,The Wandering Earth (2019),3,"I'm a science fiction fan and I was looking forward to seeing what Bug Budget Chinese Sci-Fi looked like. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. The basic plot was interesting and the graphics weren't bad. Taking into consideration that I saw a subbed version, I still thought the dialogue was pretty weak and there wasn't much characterization at all. Sometimes the characters and the plot just didn't make sense. To me the drama seemed not just forced but coerced.

It reminded me of those old 50's sci-fi movies like When World's Collide or Rocketship XM but without the cheesy charm.

This film just dragged on and on and I'll tell ya, I was not nearly as happy about the Earth being saved as I was that the movie was finally over."
8,The Wandering Earth (2019),1,"nice CGI, bull**** storyline though
A meh scifi from china riddled with bad storyline and subplots. i could not handle the personality of the crew nor the missions."
9,The Wandering Earth (2019),3,"Under the huge, chaotic and rough special effects package, the old-fashioned family and social concept is sold. As a science fiction work, the science aspect is relatively naive; the plot is basically based on incitement. Liu Cixin apparently did not live up to the influence exerted by the Revolutionary opera in childhood."
10,The Wandering Earth (2019),7,"It's such a great concept for a movie and doesn't disappoint. The visuals were impressive even by Hollywood standards, and the action was also pretty good (it's more comparable to Interstellar and The Martian than Armageddon. A good thing). But where The Wandering Earth was really satisfying was the human element. I loved how the resolution of the movie, especially the technology, were grounded in believable science for its world. And i loved that cooperation and human ingenuity were at the core of the resolution. One of the few big sci-fi movies of recent years that managed to successfully balance spectacle, intelligence, and heart. So why didn't i give it a higher mark? I'm not sure...but it's probably because while the visuals were good, they weren't great. And the musical score wasn't especially memorable either. And though i understood the story, the character relationships, the humor, i'm sure that the having to read subtitles took a little away from the experience. But i'm not nitpicking. The Wandering Earth was a terrific movie, well worth the price of admission."
11,The Wandering Earth (2019),8,"If you enjoy cheesy sci-fi disaster movies like ""Armageddon"" and ""San Andreas"" then you'll probably enjoy this, too. *It's recently been announced that Netflix has picked this up, so if you're interested and have no other options then look forward to that in the future!*

Definitely brings epicness to the table, with glamorous shots of destroyed cities, the whole planet zipping through space, and the behemoth Jupiter. If anything, this is worth the price of admission alone. The action and drama is just gravy :) . It also tries to blur the line between selflessness and selfishness, and which would better serve the overall goal of survival of the many versus few.

What brings it down is some of the drama felt too artificial, especially when tied with the annoying characters. There isn't a convincing reason for the son to hate his dad so much, especially after 17 years of time and knowing what's stake. Some scenes also don't make much sense (one of the trivia does shed a little light on a couple things), and though the whole concept is unique, I can't look past the unrealistic science (but that's just me, and didn't impact my rating).

I do hope this movie bears more fruit since the creativity and grand scale is highly refreshing."
12,The Wandering Earth (2019),6,"This is China's 1st attempt at a big blockbuster sci-fi film. The IMAX 3D was very impressive, but the movie itself is very similar to all other Hollywood disaster films that has a gluttony of too much non-stop action scenes. This movie reminds me of a mashup between 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day and Armageddon."
13,The Wandering Earth (2019),5,"As far as effects go Wandering Earth is certainly up there with the big boys. As for story content, nah not so. A little disappointing as we get into it right away with no preamble were we are introduced to all the protagonists. Subbies dont usually worry me but unfortunately this time they took away from the overall spectacle. If sci-fi is your thing then definitely watch this on a big screen."
14,The Wandering Earth (2019),2,"To be honest, I didn't have much expectation going into this and wanted to see what this new wave of Chinese movies has to offer and once again was a bit disappointed just like I was with Operation Red Sea.

In short, I think this would only appeal to Chinese audience and/or someone used to the style of movies produced by the Chinese directors, but I feel this needs to be elaborated a bit more.

The Wondering Earth is essentially a sci-fi space action movie reminiscent of films like Armageddon and Deep Impact where some sort of a disaster threatens Earth in some way. China took it up a level of course and decided to include a few highly unrealistic scenarios such as a suddenly expanding sun (which in some sense they link to the idea of climate change, which to me is almost a political statement rather than something scientific) threatens everyone on Earth.

Solution? Relocate Earth - this is what you should have gotten from the basic movie description and the trailer as well. And it's pretty much what the movie is about. Except of course it's filled with absolutely ludicrous plot twists, horrible science confusing timeline and - this is actually why I really didn't like the movie - jerky, hectic action scenes that are very hard to follow. On top of that, all of the action in the movie is absolutely not necessary and does not add to any of the plot progression and pretty much every death in the film was completely unnecessary. If this wasn't enough, The Wondering Earth is full of character and racial stereotypes and a lot of political pro-China statements that some people may find offensive.

Overall, this movie is maybe fun to watch with a group of friends over a few beers to laugh at the ridiculousness of the premise and how it's executed - especially the final resolution that ""saves the Earth"". But anyone genuinely interested in good sci-fi based on at least somewhat realistic science (think The Expanse) - do yourself a favor and save 2 hours of your life - it's totally NOT worth it."
15,The Wandering Earth (2019),9,"It is one of my best Chinese film, as it contained many kinds of educational knowledge, like it was filmed in Qingdao, and many environmental problems needs to be beware, it touched my heart terribly.

Very touching!"
16,The Wandering Earth (2019),9,"Wandering Earth is undoubtedly a monumental film for Chinese cinema, but it is not without flaws. The CG and visual effect of the film is on par with Hollywood sci-fi and like many things Chinese nowadays, even more grandiose than many of them. The film is also able to rid itself of many Chinese movie Stereotypes by smartly utilizing several loopholes, and this effort has to be commended. It is also great to see Chinese imagination at work as the filmmakers transform China into a world that nobody has ever dared wander into. The science is also easy to understand and appeals to the masses, and we also get to see Chinese heroism in a modern setting, something that needs to be done more regularly. But as a film many lines still feel recited for emotional purposes that feels out of place, and the Wu Jing subplot feels out of place and unnatural, he is simply not a great fit for the movie and takes the audience into his previous work through his stoic monotonous performance. Regardless, this is a monumental movie, an enjoyable ride that is proudly Chinese. I suspect there will now be a line of emulators that will fail miserably. Sometimes one is not too few."
17,The Wandering Earth (2019),5,"The movie is groundbreaking for China in that the special effects are impressive and that it shows they can do sci-fi in design. Sadly, aside from that, there's not much to like about the movie.

To put into context first, Wandering Earth cannot be compared to a Marvel or DC Comics movie nor to most sci-fi movies: they are completely different genres and are much less likely to involve human cooperation. At it's core Wandering Earth is a 'doomsday' or 'disaster' movie. It should be compared to movies like: The Day After Tomorrow; Armageddon; Deep Impact; Outbreak; Contagion; etc.

In that context, Wandering Earth has a very basic, standard plot. The characters are similar, except exaggerated and over the top. Together, aside from the usual interdepartment and/or international disagreements and eventual cooperation that can be found in such disaster movies, the plot and characters sum up to: ""Young, handsome rebel who hates his dad (unreasonably) and acts selfishly in all but the final moments ends up a hero"".

The acting is weak. Character motivations are vague and often elaborated on only at the moment of death or near death (eg. through flashbacks), so there is no bonding with the characters on the way there. The main character swings back and forth between wanting to sacrifice all humanity to selfishly save his own friends and family (which would be very temporary) and wanting to sacrifice other people's lives to save all humanity. There is zero chance of ever feeling any connection or sympathy with that character. Potentially moving/touching moments are ruined by the way-too-obvious comedic relief characters (eg. watch someone important die, then laugh because the guy with white hair did something silly). The 'action' arc is ""intro - climax - climax - climax - climax - climax - climax - conclusion"" to the point that the climax just feels like it's dragging on and on.

Worst of all: There is an amazing sci-fi premise that is pulled off spectactularly with the special effects, but it amounts to nothing. It is the backdrop for just another disaster movie."
18,The Wandering Earth (2019),8,"This was a decent sci-fi action movie in the likes of Armageddon. with grand special effects and scenery. Wu Jing the lead character did a pretty good job at dramatic acting, while normally he is known for his martial art movies, but in Wolf Warrior we got a glimpse that he can act the drama aswell.

I read The Wandering Earth short story from chinese award winning sci-fi author Cixin Liu, and how this film ended we are in for more and probably a sequel. The journey to Proxima Centauri is set to be 2500 years, spanning 100 generations, if done well, thats bound to leave room for more stories and maybe a starting point for a franchise!"
19,The Wandering Earth (2019),10,"All we want is superb sci-fi story and this movie deliver it very well. it's a must watch, don't hesitate."
20,The Wandering Earth (2019),5,"The idea of the earth being moved from one solar system to another is really difficult to accept. Wisely, the filmmakers fill The Wandering Earth with plenty of subplots that are compelling enough to overcome the implausibility of the main plotline. This film borrows heavily from Space 1999, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Gravity, Armageddon, Aliens, and other science fiction sources. The sets look great, but some of the visual effects look a little too much like the computer generated images they are. The music is particularly good."
