Captain Marvel (2019)",4,"The last 5 minutes of the movie boosted my rating from a 2 to a 4, great graphics. I have watched all MCU movies and give the first Avengers a 10. Constant action and well developed characters. CM was BORING and Larsons wears her smug personality on her sleeve. Compare this movie to ALITA which i thought was perfect. Scary thought that a CGI character displays more personaltiy and believability than a Brie Larson. The studio knows CM is not a good movie, thats why they are rigging the votes and scores... And buying seats in theaters to boost the illusion its a hit movie.

We live in an altered world where news is fake, and now even the movie scores cannot be trusted. After all Im a white male and i must have an agenda for thinking Captain Pootiepants is the worst MCU movie to date."

Captain Marvel (2019)",4,"318. Captain Marvel. The story of a small town girl living in a lonely world, that works on top secret technology, then gets zapped by that technology turning her into a super hero with no memory!! An alien super hero with no memory, but wait no, she's a human, transfused with alien blood with no memory... cause she's kinda kidnapped by these aliens called Kree, the good looking ones, who are at war with the ugly ones called Skrulls. And as the war comes to Earth, truths come out, and she comes face to face with Nick Fury, and doing some quick math, Nick Fury is ummm, old. But anyways. It's a fun movie, with a rather generic storyline to introduce a character, that was kind of hinted at in the last few seconds of Avengers Infinity War. Filmbufftim on FB."

Captain Marvel (2019)",1,"I am not a huge comic book fan but enjoyed most Marvel movies for their action and humour as well as their interesting stories. Other than losing points for SJW garbage, the story just seemed to be a string of events. It had no highs and lows. A bunch of stuff happened for 2 hours. I heard they had to rewrite the ending several times which shows it had a weak idea of the story."

Captain Marvel (2019)",4,"The main problem in this film was Brie Larson, really. Terrible actress, no charm or carism and she don't know how to fight. Brings Iron Fist series to my memory. Valkyre was better as fighter than this version of Carol Denvers. This is a film about a woman who want to prove for the wolrd he is capable. That's it. But ironically, there is no moment that she deserves this power at all. The Marvel Universe was in second plane. Sad. Sorry, she can't be the main character on this second phase of MCU, if yes, i think we will have a stranger years in the future."

Captain Marvel (2019)",1,"Seriously, can I rewind life by two hours and not watch the film? I swore I wasn't bothered about seeing this film, but having a son who's a big Marvel film fan, we watched it. Turns out it received a lukewarm reception from him as well. Why is Goose the best thing about this film? Why is there so much hype about this film? I truly don't know. I thought I needed to see this film before Endgame, so I was suckered by the son into seeing it. Both of us wish we hadn't bothered. My son and I both love Marvel and DC. We say Marvel for films and DC for series, but this, well honestly, it felt more like a DC flop of a film, not what we have come to expect from some amazing Marvel films."

Captain Marvel (2019)",8,"As a long-time IMDB reviewer, I have noticed that often films which haven't even been released have received a lot of reviews on this site. In a few cases, it's because folks saw the films at pre-screenings (such as at film festivatls), but for most it's more insidious. Some films appear to have many fake reviews--either fake positive ones (often, I assume, posted by the production companies or actors in the films) and some fake negative (such as when a fan group decides to attack a movie for some perceived slight). In the case of ""Captain Marvel"" the fake negative attacks were so many that Rotten Tomatoes decided for the first time, to not allow reviews of the film before its release. It seems a lot of fan guys objected to the perceived political correctness of the movie....and they were posting without even having seen the movie. I notice there are ALSO a lot of angry reviews here on IMDB as well...and many appear to have been posted before the film was released. Because of this, it must be very frustrating for you trying to determine whether or not it's a film worth seeing. I could say ""trust me....I am objective""....but without knowing me, I, too, could be one of these folks posting a false negative or false positive review! So, I guess you'll need to see it for yourself.

For the most part, I tired of watching superhero films long ago....mostly because after a while they all seem the same. But my daughter is visiting now and she wanted to see ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Shazam!"", so I broke my resolve and went along to see these comic book-based films.

I enjoyed ""Captain Marvel"" very much because it did not feel like all the other DC and Marvel films. It had a few distinctive touches which made it more exciting and worth my time. Much of it takes place in outer space and apart from bits of ""Thor"" and the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" franchises, which also take place in space, it sets the film apart. It also sets itself apart by having a female lead. And, like ""Wonder Woman"", a ton of trolls hated on the film before it was released because it had the nerve to actually have a woman in the lead! This is sad, as Brie Larson was fine in the lead and did a nice job. Ditto for the writing, as the plot had a few very nice surprises and the film kept my interest throughout. Well worth seeing and quite the adventure."

Captain Marvel (2019)",7,"Vers (Brie Larson) is a powered member of the Kree Empire mentored by Commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law). The Kree is under attack from the shapeshifting Skrulls. During a battle, Vers is captured where the Skrulls try to extract her memories. She had lost her memories six years earlier. With flashes of recovered memories, she escapes and crashes onto a Los Angeles Blockbuster. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and new agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) arrive to investigate. It's 1995 before Fury executed the Avengers Initiative. Vers searches for Dr. Wendy Lawson (Annette Bening) who is the key to her past.

It's a prequel. It's an origin story. It's an exposition movie. It's a connective tissue movie. It's a female empowerment story. It's a Marvel movie. It's trying to be a lot of stuff. Despite that, it's fairly uncomplicated. It runs well without hitting any major potholes. It introduces a new hero. It gives her a very specific identity. It still has a few issues. First, Brie Larson is doing a specific character but the role is lacking in range. Essentially, she starts off with amnesia and that's not always great for character work. It's almost as bad as being brainwashed and comes off as robotic. There is one moment of great possibility when Carol is across the table with Maria for the first time in a while. That could have been a really powerful moment of female friendship. Akira Akbar is acting her butt off but Brie is restricted to her memory blanks. Her memories could have flooded back as she emotionally breaks down. They could have hugged and yes why not even shed a tear. Her character needs a different gear. The role is stuck in the robotic amnesia Jason Bourne mode. Bourne could have been a solid choice but that's not this movie either. She's wise-cracking right from the start but that's the limit of her emotional range.

Second is her memory flashbacks. Instead of showing those memories early, the movie should have kept them from the audience. It becomes repetitive and we are forced to wait for Carol to catch up. The movie needs to keep the audience at the same level as Carol in her discovery. It should only reveal each memory as it comes up in the plot. Her meeting with Maria should be the point where most of her flashbacks occur like when her extended memory of the inciting incident is triggered. The movie needs to rearrange a few things.

The other characters are solid. Fury is great. His humor really works. The music is mostly popular 90's female alternative voices. It's not unexpected but the climax starts with No Doubt's Just A Girl which is awkward for hitting it on its tippy tip nose. It's a weird song to fight to. It could have also added a few more male singers. It's deliberately doing something which seems unnecessary and the music taste is too similar. Why not NIN or a rapper to change the tone? I hope that Carol will be a deeper character in the future. She could face a more personal challenge with an older Monica. This film is filling out a lot of story blanks whether we like it or not, and preparing for the upcoming Avengers movie. It's fine. The Marvel universe continues."

Captain Marvel (2019)",6,"This was the next entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the leading hero was called upon at the end of Avengers: Infinity War, but this is a prequel to how the whole Avengers project got started, and an origins story for the female hero, the first leading female in the series, directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson). Basically in 1995, on the planet of Hala, the capital of the Kree Empire, Starforce member Vers (Room's Brie Larson) is having recurring nightmares involving an older woman (Annette Bening). Her mentor and commander Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) trains her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an artificial intelligence and the ruler of the Kree, urges her to control her emotions. The Kree are at war with the Skrulls, a race of alien shapeshifters, Vers is captured by their commander Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) during a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a Skrull group. She is taken aboard their vessel bound for the planet Earth and subjected to a memory probe. Vers escapes and crash-lands on Earth in Los Angeles in a Blockbuster store, she is found by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg). Their investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack, following the chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories, while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Keller (also Mendelsohn), orders Fury to work with Vers and keep an eye on her. Fury takes Vers to a U.S. Air Force base and discovers she was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989. She was testing an experimental engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, Vers recognises her as the woman from her nightmares. Talos and a S.H.I.E.L.D. tries to capture them, but they escape in a cargo jet, with Lawson's cat Goose. They fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Just as Vers discovers her real name is Carol Danvers, Talos arrives at the Rambeau house, he reveals the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and Lawson was a renegade Kree scientist helping them. He then plays the recovered black box from Lawson's plane, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg before she could destroy the engine's energy-core, Danvers was forced to do so and absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, this is how she lost her memory. Danvers, Talos, Fury and Rambeau work together to locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls including Talos' family, and the Tesseract, the source of the energy-core. Danvers is captured by Starforce and connects with the Supreme Intelligence, during their conversation she is able to access all her abilities, by removing the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien with a pocket dimension inside her body and swallows the Tesseract before scratching Fury's left eye, permanently blinding it. Danvers, who earns the nickname Captain Marvel, leaves to help find a new homeworld for the Skrulls and gives Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative aimed at locating heroes like her, with abilities, he changes the name of the project after seeing a photo of Danvers in her Air Force jet, which bears the call sign ""Avenger"". In the mid-credits sequence, set in the present day, Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), the remaining Avengers, are monitoring the pager that Fury activated before his disintegration, Danvers appears and demands to know where Fury is. In the post-credits sequence, back in 1995, Goose jumps onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract. Also starring Rune Temte as Bron-Char, Gemma Chan as Minn-Erva, Algenis Perez Soto as Att-Lass, Djimon Hounsou as Korath, Lee Pace as Ronan, Chuku Modu as Soh-Larr, Matthew Maher as Norex, Kenneth Mitchell as Carol's Father, Mckenna Grace as Young Carol (13 Years Old), London Fuller as Young Carol (6 Years Old), Colin Ford as Steve Danvers, Robert Kazinsky as Biker (The Don), Marilyn Brett as Older Lady on Train and Stan Lee (who sadly passed away from cancer) has a posthumous cameo as himself reading the script for his role in Mallrats, the opening Marvel Studios logo also honours his memory with clips of his cameos and on-set moment, and the words ""Thank You Stan"". Larson is well chosen as the feisty human-turned-alien heroine, Jackson is terrific and the younger future director of the Avengers, the verbal sparring between Larson and Jackson make for some highlights, and there is good support from Mendelsohn, Law and Bening. The references to the 1990s time period are clever, the special effects are amazing, especially to make Jackson twenty years younger, it does slow down at times for the necessary chat sequences, but there are enough small giggles, it packs a punch with the explosive and exciting fight and chase sequences, and it sets you up nicely for Avengers: Endgame, a fun superhero fantasy action adventure. Good!"

Captain Marvel (2019)",10,"The film takes place in 1995. It shows us the event that causes Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to lose an eye. We first see Captain Marvel as Vers (Brie Larson) on the planet Hala being trained by the Kree to kill enemy shapeshifters. Her memory is gone from the time she was on C-53 (Earth). She finds herself back on Earth battling shapeshifters, defending the universe...and then the twist.

I liked the strong female role, competing and winning in a man's universe. Stan Lee gives us a smile in his usual spot. Good characters."

Captain Marvel (2019)",6,"I have said it before and I will say it again. The Marvel Cinematic Universe are on a higher plane compared to other superhero franchises. They can knock it out of the park, shot after shot.

I went to this movie knowing almost nothing about Captain Marvel apart from there was originally another DC character with the same name who became Shazam.

The film takes a little while to get going as it wants to set up the character of Vers/Carol Danvers (Brie Larson.) Vers is a warrior recruited by the Kree. They are fighting the evil Skrulls who take over planets by infiltrating them. They are shapeshifters led by Talos (Ben Mendelsohn.)"

Captain Marvel (2019)",8,"After all the hype about this movie, I'll just say that me and my movie theatre-working friend really enjoyed this one! Brie Larson stars as Vers though we later find out she's had amnesia and that her real name is Carol Danvers. She also finds out about where her loyalties should be when she regains some of her memories. There's plenty of good action concerning her and some of her friends. Also, Stan Lee makes one of his last cameos having passed away several months ago. As a result, the Marvel logo at the beginning has his other cameos over the years with the greeting, ""Thank you Stan"" at the end of that. So on that note, we recommend Captain Marvel."

18,"
Captain Marvel (2019)",8,"Vers(Larson, strong, not always embracing her humanity, stirring. Just like the film itself) has only a fractured memory of her past. Over the course of this, she recalls many of the most significant parts. Originally from Earth, she was given a new life and set of abilities by the Kree, an alien race. She's now part of an elite team of theirs. Don't worry about the other members; you're not going to remember them, or need to. They're like less developed ""Warriors Three"" from Thor: though, I realise they're from the comics, if you had shaved it down to maybe just one, then that person could actually get something substantial. To do, say, be. Anyway. She has to keep a secret weapon out of the hands of the shapeshifting Skrulls. Through certain circumstances, She ends up back on this planet, and immediately attracts the attention of young desk jockey SHIELD agent Nick Fury(Jackson, less cynical than usual, which is a welcome change. Not that I didn't love him before. but it would be annoying if he was like that this whole thing. Instead we get a buddy comedy dynamic), who comes out of the de-aging looking real, and rookie Coulson(Gregg, less confident), who, in contrast, at times looks like he considers petroleum jelly a form of makeup.

The action is great and plentiful, the effects are stunning, the 3D adds depth and atmosphere, the twists and mysteries keep you guessing, the villains are compelling, and the humour nearly always works. Then again, that isn't only true of this entry. So let's focus on this being the first of them that is feminist. That aspect is less focused than in Wonder Woman - the DCEU has always been taking bigger risks than the MCU, and that was one of the times where it paid off. Aquaman is the other one. Fingers crossed Shazam will be the third. It would not have been difficult to make this more about empowering women: for one thing simply make more of the characters female, even if they are men in the source material, and add more of the issues that they face. So I would say it's a case of simply being too scared to go for something unusual for them. I guess they figured they couldn't repeat the success of Black Panther, which delved incredibly deep into racial issues. Like WW, however, this will inspire young and old Members of the gender: where that motion picture was very much about feminine qualities and values solving problems that masculine ones cause, this is more about meeting the standard that men set, and surpassing it: hence, ""higher, further, faster"". While I tend to consider the former as the more progressive of the two, obviously there are a lot who want to do certain things, and are told that they can't live up to the requirements, for reasons physical, emotional, and psychological. Those saying no may even pretend that there's no sexism involved. And this will urge them to keep trying, with aforementioned three word motto serving as a rallying war cry, if you'll permit a portmanteau.

There is a little strong language in this. I recommend this to everyone, XX-chromosomes in particular, not exclusively. 8/10"

Captain Marvel (2019)",6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Girl Power! Not only does this serve as an origin story for Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, but Anna Boden becomes the first female director of a Marvel movie (she co-directed with Ryan Fleck, and they previously collaborated on IT""S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY, SUGAR, and HALF NELSON). It's Marvel's first solo female superhero movie, and even though it's actually a prequel to what we've previously seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it clearly sets the table for AVENGERS: ENDGAME and the showdown with Thanos later this year.

Oscar winner Brie Larson (ROOM) stars as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel, and the film opens with her as Vers, a human-Kree hybrid and a soldier of Starforce being trained by Yon-Rogg (Jude Law) for a role in the Kree-Skrulls war. Part of the training includes regular reminders to keep her emotions under control ... see, not only is Vers a woman but she also shoots sonic blasts from her fists. The filmmakers have not presented her story in chronological order, but have instead utilized flashbacks and memories to let us (and Carol) in on how she obtained her immense powers.

In Marvel tradition, the film uses much humor as it progresses. Proving that the action takes place in the 1990's, the roof literally comes down on a Blockbuster video store (foreshadowing future financial events), as Vers crashes to earth. Soon she has met young agents Fury and Coulson, played by digitally de-aged Samuel L Jackson and Clark Gregg, respectively. This is of course pre-eye patch Fury, though we do get that origin story a bit later in the film. As Vers peruses the Blockbuster shelves, we get a tip of the cap to THE RIGHT STUFF and TRUE LIES, and soon thereafter, a nod to Radio Shack, pay phones, pinball machines, pagers, and 90's era internet speed. The retro bits may be a bit overdone, but the millennial target audience will surely enjoy.

The always interesting Ben Mendelsohn plays Talos, the leader of the shape-shifting Krulls - who also sport the best make-up as they transform from pointy-eared green aliens into exact replicas of humans. Lee Pace returns as Ronan the Accuser, while Djimon Hounsou is Korath and Gemma Chan is Minn-Erva, both part of Starforce. Annette Bening plays the AI Supreme Intelligence, while Mckenna Grace appears as young Carol in flashbacks.

The glimpses of Carol Danvers as a US Air Force fighter pilot lead to the best dramatic scenes of the film - her reuniting with fellow pilot Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch) and Maria's daughter Monica (Akira Akbar). At first I was taken aback that Marvel dared cast a black actress in the role of stereotypical supportive sidekick, but then Ms. Lynch got her own impressive action chase sequence (similar to STAR WARS) and kicked some serious alien tail. Those familiar with the comics know that Maria Rambeau is the mother of Photon, a character likely to appear deeper in the universe.

The co-directors also co-wrote the script with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, and Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve contributed to the story. The strong female presence is impressive both on camera and off, as Pinar Toprak's score complemented the heavy 1990's rock music soundtrack. Again, nostalgia seems ever-present, as does the humor (Goose the cat/flerken) and good fun that existed in THOR: RAGNAROK and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Carol Danvers and her backstory also seem a bit more relatable than that of WONDER WOMAN.

Marvel offered up a nice tribute to the late Stan Lee by providing a new opening featuring his many cameos over the years. And yes, he was able to film his cameo for this one prior to his death in November 2018. So we have an origin story not just of Captain Marvel, but also of the Fury eye patch, the Avengers Initiative, and a prequel to all Marvel movies we've seen in the past few years. Two post-film stingers are included: one expected and necessary, while the other is good for a laugh. It's an inspiring story of a young girl who repeatedly fell down and got up and brushed herself off every time - even before her fists and eye balls could shoot energy streams. It's fitting and about time that young girls now have their own superhero to emulate."
21,"
Captain Marvel (2019)",8,"I didn't walk into ""Captain Marvel"" expecting more than a girls-kick-ass movie, which, given the massive hype behind this film, was a fairly low bar. One of the problems I've had with the marketing is introducing Carol Danvers as Deus Ex Machina for defeating Thanos.

The good news is that the movie easily surpasses expectations because there's actually a character here. She's as powerful inside as she is externally, and that's what ultimately makes this work. I was (as always) impressed with Brie Larson, although the script didn't offer her many chances to actually speak. It's to her credit that she charms with what she's given.

The real surprise to me is that I enjoyed this movie in the larger MCU sense than just on the origin story basis - and I can't remember the last time this has happened. I liked Nick Fury's expanded role here, his youthful CGI work is impressive, and those scenes in which he has sort of a buddy relationship with Carol were very nice. Also love that he is a cat person.

So yeah, she's super powerful, but it's earned, and this actually made me excited for the next Marvel movie (and I've been suffering burn-out for years)."

Captain Marvel (2019)",3,"God, I love Brie Larson. Loved her in Scott Pilgrim and absolutely agreed with her Oscar for Room. So what the bleep happened here?

It is hard to think back to the many, MANY superheroes of the past couple of decades to find a superhero SO plain, SO boring, SO shallow, SO lifeless and without a bit of soul or personality as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. I had to check to see if George Lucas directed this, because I definitely saw the female Anakin Skywalker here.

She was so bad, or her character, at least, she took me completely out of the movie. I never once rooted for her, couldn't care less about her plight and frankly was just waiting for her to end up right where I knew she would thanks to the third Avengers movie. And that's sad, because the movie isn't necessarily a bad one...it's just the title character had none of that Marvel as suggested.

Erasing the bore, I loved how the movie was shot. Set in the mid-90s, it, of course, had a kick-ass 90s soundtrack (all of my favorites!!) and the familiar technology and stores from back then. But, bypassing that, the movie FELT like it was shot, edited, paced and scripted like it was from the 1990s. I totally felt transported back to my favorite decade and I praise this movie for that.

In a rather quick and easy to follow setup, we learn our title character wants to join an elite group of alien warriors hell-bent on stopping shapeshifters from destroying their protected worlds. Naturally, the one focused on in the movie is Earth and there, our ""hero"" has to track the shapeshifters with no other than Nick ""call him"" Fury.

Sadly, the movie is predictable from minute one and this is not just because it ties into many other MCU films. Normally, that would bother me, but again, the filmmaking all felt really 90s to me, so I'm pretty familiar with the old formulas.

Only a select handful of jokes landed, mostly from Sam Jackson and the special effects were good, not great. Too many of the older actors looked fake as younger versions of themselves. Despite that, it was so nice seeing Annette Bening again. It's been far too long.

I didn't hate the movie, but will only give it a VERY mild recommendation. If Captain Marvel/Brie Larson wasn't so incredibly and painfully dull, we would've had a MUCH BETTER Marvel outing. It even ended somewhat solidly for her, but not enough to make up for the previous 2-hours of sleepwalking she did.

***

Final thoughts: Admirable on the opening Marvel Logo and the 1st post-credit scene: totally worth it, especially since it's only 1-2 minutes into the 20-minute end credits. You can absolutely skip the last post-credit scene and just Google it when you get home."

Captain Marvel (2019)",7,"It says a lot about the mammoth universe built by Kevin Feige and the folks at Marvel over the past 11 years that merely the glimpse of a modified pager displaying the colours of their costume is enough to generate a huge amount of buzz around the arrival of a new superhero. Captain Marvel's introduction was teased during the traditional post-credits stinger of last year's Avengers: Infinity War, and now, just under a year later, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers finally makes her bow. Black Panther became a cultural phenomenon, and Infinity War delivered and then some on its promise to bring this breathtaking (first) saga closer to an end, so the small-scale and light-hearted Ant-Man and the Wasp was a welcome, if underwhelming palette cleanser. Captain Marvel is the studio's first female-led superhero film, so there's a weight of expectation behind Marvel once again."

Captain Marvel (2019)",9,"In a rather surprising turnaround, what seemed mostly a good, but not really that great superhero movie turned on its afterburners for the last twenty minutes of the movie to make quite a show of it. Most of this movie was pretty much simplified overkill, token humor, and a lot of show off special effects, action sequences that really felt like a pretty masculine derivative. The tone of the movie also uncharacteristically wavered some during the first half of the movie. A disoriented and disjointed first half of the movie which was supposedly part of the nature of the storyline of this movie, but it wasn't effectively presented. With a little bit of Ender's Game (2013) intrigue the movie twist was pretty effective, if not stunning along with a smidgen of reverse ethnic psychology. The observable 3-D technological enhancement continues to progress helping to offer an almost awesome display of immersive reality. Not quite there yet. Overall, this movie almost didn't come through and can't really be considered a complete success owing to its rather average beginning. But the storyline and the ending performances shine resulting in of the few movies to make it out of its crash dive with a stunning and heartful conclusion that just barely earns a nine out of ten."
